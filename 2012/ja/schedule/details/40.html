  <h2>タイトル</h2>
  <p class="title">Ruby; Exported</p>
  <h2>概要</h2>
  <p>Ruby is known to have been inspired by many programming languages, especially Lisp and Perl. Most notably Perl&#39;s principle &quot;TIMTOWTDI&quot; motto was imported to Ruby as the &quot;Diversity matters&quot; concept.</p>

<p>Similarly, some concepts in successful Ruby projects such as Rails (CoC, full-stack MVC framework) and Sinatra (dead-simple DSL to write web applications) have inspired other programming language communities, but not all of them have been successful doing so.</p>

<p>In this talk, I&#39;ll take some examples of projects where I&#39;ve been shamelessly inspired by Ruby&#39;s equivalents (Rack, Unicorn and Bundler) and how it has been successfully exported to and accepted by the Perl developers community.</p>
