    Currently, we are working on Ruby 2.0 which will be released next February. 
    In particular, we are enjoying rewriting the virtual machine (VM) of 
    Ruby 2.0 as a member of Matz's team in Heroku, Inc. - to make it more 
    useful, high performance, low resource consuming and more sophisticated. 
    In this presentation, we will talk about the progress of VM implementation 
    including (1) new features related to VM internal such as 
    profiling/debugging support and (2) progress of performance of 
    improvement of Ruby 2.0 interpreter.  We will also show the plan toward 
    Ruby 2.0 release.
