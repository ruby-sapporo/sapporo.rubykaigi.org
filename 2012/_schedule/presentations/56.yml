    Towards Ruby 2.0: Progress of VM Internals
abstract:

  en: |-
    Currently, we are working on Ruby 2.0, which will be released next February. 
    In particular, we are enjoying rewriting the virtual machine (VM) of 
    Ruby 2.0 as a member of Matz's team in Heroku, Inc. - to make it more 
    useful, high performance, low resource consuming and more sophisticated. 
    In this presentation, we will talk about the progress of VM implementation 
    including (1) new features related to VM internals such as 
    profiling/debugging support and (2) progress with improving the 
    performance of the Ruby 2.0 interpreter. We will also show plans for 
    the release of Ruby 2.0.
