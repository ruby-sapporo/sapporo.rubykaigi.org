    Are you fed up with Objective-C? Now, you can build iOS apps with mruby.

    MobiRuby aims to replace Objective-C/C/Java on mobile platforms with Ruby, just like you can use Lua or Mono to build apps on those platforms. 

    In this presentation, I will talk about how to create iOS app using MobiRuby and MobiRuby internals.
