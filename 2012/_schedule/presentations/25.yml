    Everybody talks about scaling up, but, what happens when you have to scale
    down? or even, what happens when you don't control where your product is
    being deployed? In this session we'll talk about how we build GitHub
    enterprise, keeping every feature that you can find in github.com, and how
    we ship it ready to deploy on your infrastructure.
