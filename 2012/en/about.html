  <h2>About Sapporo RubyKaigi 2012</h2>
  <p>Sapporo Ruby Kaigi is one local chapter of Ruby Kaigi, which is an international conference, which has been held from 2008. It is dedicated to the Ruby programing language Ruby.</p>

  <p>Despite the conference being held in the relatively remote (when compared to Tokyo) Sapporo, it is regarded as a top-tier conference were Rubyist from all over assemble. The last time Sapporo Ruby Kaigi was held, there were about 150 participants who attended in a single day.</p>

  <p>For installment, Sapporo Ruby Kaigi 2012, will be held for 3 days, from September 14th to 16th at Sapporo Business Innovation Center. This year marks the first occasion Sapporo Ruby Kaigi will be held over three days. We expect more people to participate the conference than ever before. </p>

  <p>This time, the theme of Sapporo Ruby Conference will be “We Code”.</p>

  <p>We are going to examine with whom you write code, why you write code, and how code is written. We hope that this conference will be a place that the attendees can share various thoughts about their own "coding" activities.</p>

  <p>We hope to see you at the conference.</p>
