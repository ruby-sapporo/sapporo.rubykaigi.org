  <p class="title">What We Talk About When We Talk About Code</p>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Code can be many things to many different people. It is automation as well as communication -- between a person and a machine, but also between two or more people. People understand code differently. Consider the difference in understanding between a total beginner and a veteran developer. Code is not only understood differently, it is valued differently. “Good code” means something completely different to a developer than it does to a product manager. Anyone who works in software for a significant period of time begins to realize that writing code is only a small portion of our day to day work and that there is a great difference between “writing good code” and “writing good software.” How can we use these different perspectives to see code from a new perspective? How can thinking about code differently help us as developers?</p>
