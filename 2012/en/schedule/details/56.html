  <p class="title">Towards Ruby 2.0: Progress of VM Internals</p>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Currently, we are working on Ruby 2.0, which will be released next February. 
In particular, we are enjoying rewriting the virtual machine (VM) of 
Ruby 2.0 as a member of Matz&#39;s team in Heroku, Inc. - to make it more 
useful, high performance, low resource consuming and more sophisticated. 
In this presentation, we will talk about the progress of VM implementation 
including (1) new features related to VM internals such as 
profiling/debugging support and (2) progress with improving the 
performance of the Ruby 2.0 interpreter. We will also show plans for 
the release of Ruby 2.0.</p>
