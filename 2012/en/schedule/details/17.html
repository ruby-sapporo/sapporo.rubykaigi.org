  <p class="title">Let your test drive your development</p>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>I&#39;ll talk about &quot;thought&quot; during writing developer tests by RSpec, Cucumber, etc. as
I would like audiences to let their tests help their software development.</p>

<p>Some may think that tests are <em>interrupters</em> of software development although
TDD has now become an essential part of Ruby development.
Newbies often worry about &#39;What to test?&#39; or &#39;How many tests should I write?&#39; and that stays their hand.</p>

<p>I think tests are good <em>drivers</em> of development. So I&#39;ll give an answer to the above based on my experience.</p>
