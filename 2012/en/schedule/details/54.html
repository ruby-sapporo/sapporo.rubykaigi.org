  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>When I started my career as a programmer, I was not happy. There were too many hard things. Then I changed my job, and found Ruby. After that, I have been working with agile programming practices such as pair programinng and enjoying Ruby communities. Ruby has changed my life thoroughly; I AM VERY HAPPY.</p>

<p>These days, Ruby is widely used, and I think there are some people who are working as a Ruby programmer already but not confident as a Rubyist, not a member of the Ruby community though having an interest in it. Also, new programmers are coming to Ruby because web application development and deployment is getting easier.</p>

<p>I just want to talk to these people about &#39;How to enter Ruby communities&#39; and &#39;How to enjoy Ruby&#39;.</p>
