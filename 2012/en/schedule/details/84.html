  <p class="title">User Oriented Service Design</p>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>We proposed &quot;user oriented service design&quot; as a service design method by users. For example, it is difficult to design services for a wide variety of Web sites on the Internet. Because you have to write code to handle each Web site. But if the users can write codes to handle each Web site and collect the codes, we can fix the problem. In this presentation, I introduce AutoPagerize as an application and Wedata as the storage. Wedata is used by approximately 1,370,000 users (July 2011).  Also  the applications that uses Wedata are increased.</p>
