  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Every line of code has a story. Every block of code has a lesson. The
Heroku API is the oldest and largest codebase on the platform. This is
my story of being introduced to the code and why I&#39;ve fallen for it.</p>

<p>In this presentation I&#39;ll go through code that, at face value, may seem
strange or wrong, but offers much more when you place yourself in the
shoes of the developer at that time.</p>

<p>Legacy software may come with code you&#39;d rather not see or touch, but it
also comes with solutions to problems you don&#39;t have to relive and a
history of why certain decisions were made.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll talk about how and why inheriting legacy code can be a great
experience.</p>
