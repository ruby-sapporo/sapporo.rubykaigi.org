  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>I was engaged in the development of platforms and services related to
social media at Yahoo! Japan Corporation. I began participating in
Cookpad in January 2010 out of a desire to &quot;use technology to real
life.&quot; I came to my present post in May 2012 after serving as head of
the technology department. My goal of Cookpad is &quot;to create a company
that can bring happiness to real people by capitalizing on the
world&#39;s best technology.</p>
