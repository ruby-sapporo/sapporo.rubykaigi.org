  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p class="title">DIY programming - Code for yourself</p>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>There are people who love making furniture by themselves.
It is not so popular to make software as DIY,
but more people should be enjoying DIY programming in the future
since it is becoming more and more easy to learn programming.
We programmers are allowed to enjoy this progressive kind of life-style
in advance.</p>

<p>In this talk I will introduce various techniques
useful for making software for ourselves, in addition to software
I wrote in Ruby for myself such as music player, household account app
or tools for games.</p>
